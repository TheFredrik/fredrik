# Digital Obsidian Garden
This is the code for my digital garden, created with the [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden).

If you want your own digital garden from Obsidian notes, see the README in the plugin repo for information on how to set it up.
